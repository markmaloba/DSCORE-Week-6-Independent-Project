# Mchezopesa Ltd. football analysis


## The context
You have been recruited as a football analyst in a company - Mchezopesa Ltd and tasked to predict results of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (include rank in your training).

## Metric for success
We need the model to predict games at an industry-accepted accuracy level (70% at least). In the context of goals, that means our testing results should not vary from the training data by more than +/- 1 goal.
